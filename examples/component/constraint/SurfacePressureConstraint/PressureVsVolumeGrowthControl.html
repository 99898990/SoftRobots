<h1 id="pressure-vs.-volume-growth-actuation">Pressure vs. volume growth actuation</h1>
<p>This example illustrates the difference between pressure and volume growth actuation. Pressure based actuation represents an actuation performed by compressing a gas (air). Volume based actuation represents an actuation performed by an incompressible medium (water, oil).</p>
FYI: If the computation is slow, it might be because you did not add sparse and metis to sofa configuration.</i>

<p>The scene simulate a pressure on a cavity in the bunny body. You can either control the volume growth (right) or the pressure (left). It uses the <em>SurfacePressureConstraint</em> component, available in the SoftRobots plugin Further descriptions of the component can be found at: https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/documentation/</p>
